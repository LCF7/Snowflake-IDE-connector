# Snowflake Connection Example

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to connect to a Snowflake database, execute a SQL query, and retrieve data into a pandas DataFrame. The example focuses on best practices for handling database credentials securely.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the script, you need the following:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `snowflake-connector-python` package
- `pandas` package
- A Snowflake account

## Installation

To set up your environment to run the script, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install snowflake-connector-python pandas
   
2. Ensure you have the credentials for your Snowflake account.

## Configuration

To securely configure the database connection, we use a JSON configuration file (c_parameters.json) that is included in the repository with fake data for security reasons. Replace it with your actual Snowflake credentials.

## Usage

To run the script, ensure that your configuration file is set up and execute the Notebook with the Python scripts.

The script will connect to the Snowflake database using the credentials provided in the c_parameters.json file, execute a SQL query to fetch data from the NATION table, and print the first few rows of the result.

## Security

Using a JSON file for configuration helps to avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials directly into the code. This method enhances security by segregating sensitive information from the codebase and makes it easier to manage credentials securely, especially when working in shared or public repositories.
